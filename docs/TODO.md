### Definition of Done Template

Every task in this TODO is "done" when **all** of the following are true:
1. The task's deliverable exists in the codebase (code, test, doc, or config file)
2. All associated tests pass (`uv run pytest` — no failures)
3. `ruff check` passes with 0 errors on the new code
4. The file is **<= 150 lines** (if it's a Python file)
5. The task's commit has a meaningful message following conventional commits format
6. No hardcoded constants — all from config/env/constants
