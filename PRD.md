# PRD — AI Court Debate Simulator

## 1. Overview

**AI Court Debate Simulator** is a terminal-based Python SDK application that simulates structured debates between two AI agents (Pro / Con) on a given topic, moderated and scored by a third AI agent acting as a **Judge (Father)**. The system uses LLM-powered agents with internet search capabilities, RAG pipelines, and strict process governance (timeouts, line limits, forced termination).

The judge is **not a domain expert** — he evaluates based on **argumentation quality, logical structure, evidence use, rebuttal effectiveness, and rhetorical technique**. The same debate, run multiple times with no code changes, may produce different winners due to non-deterministic LLM outputs and varying search results.

## 2. Stakeholders

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Professor / Evaluator** | Runs the system, supplies API key via `.env`, grades per checklist |
| **Judge Agent (Father)** | Listens to debate, evaluates rounds, scores each debater, declares winner/tie |
| **Pro Agent (Son 1)** | Argues in favor of the given topic |
| **Con Agent (Son 2)** | Argues against the given topic |

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Agent System

#### 3.1.1 Judge Agent (Father)
- Acts as the **debate listener and final scorer** — does **not** intervene during the debate
- Does **not** claim domain expertise in the debate topic
- At startup, the judge searches the internet for **expert debate judging criteria** and builds his evaluation rubric from those sources
- Evaluates based on **debate craft metrics** (see §3.6)
- Enforces rules: respect, relevance, reply-compliance, time limits
- Issues **penalties** for:
  - Disrespectful language or ad hominem attacks
  - Failing to address the opponent's previous point (ignoring rebuttal)
  - Contradicting own stance (e.g., Pro agent making anti arguments)
  - Exceeding time or line limits
- After all rounds: assigns a **score (%)** to each debater and declares a winner (**or tie** — ties are valid)
- Outputs full scoring breakdown as JSON
- **Communication is one-directional**: Sons → Father (Father does not communicate back to sons during debate)

#### 3.1.2 Debater Agents (Sons)
- Each debater is **randomly assigned** a stance: **Pro** or **Con** (they do not choose)
- Each debater is given the topic and performs **internet research** before the debate begins
- During each round, the debater **must reply to the opponent's previous argument** — not ignore it
- Each debater has a configurable **line limit** per response and **time limit** per turn
- If a debater's response contradicts their assigned stance, the judge penalizes them
- Debaters must maintain a **respectful tone** — politically correct, no racism, no ad hominem
- Each debater has a **Skill** it cannot refuse to use (its core competency)

### 3.2 Debate Topics

- **10 pre-configured debate topics** are bundled with the project
- Topics span 5 categories: **History, Current Affairs, Sports, Science, Culture** (2 per category)
- Topics are designed to have clear Pro/Con positions with room for evidence-based argumentation
- Users may also pass a **custom topic** via CLI argument
- Each topic includes a brief context blurb so agents understand the framing

| # | Category | Topic | Pro Position | Con Position |
|---|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Sports | Barcelona vs Real Madrid — greatest football club | Barcelona | Real Madrid |
| 2 | Sports | Individual sports build character better than team sports | For | Against |
| 3 | Science | AI will replace most jobs by 2050 | For | Against |
| 4 | Science | Nuclear energy is the solution to climate change | For | Against |
| 5 | History | The British Empire did more good than harm | For | Against |
| 6 | History | Ancient Rome's collapse was inevitable | For | Against |
| 7 | Current Affairs | Universal Basic Income should be implemented globally | For | Against |
| 8 | Current Affairs | Social media does more harm than good to democracy | For | Against |
| 9 | Culture | Art should never be censored | For | Against |
| 10 | Culture | Remote work weakens company culture | For | Against |

### 3.3 Debate Flow

```
1. User selects topic (or provides custom topic) via CLI
2. System initializes 3 agents (Judge + 2 Debaters) as separate processes
3. Judge fetches debate judging criteria from internet (search)
4. Both debaters perform internet research on the topic in parallel
5. Debate begins — 10 Pings (rounds), each side speaks once per ping:
   Ping N:
     a. Pro Agent presents argument/rebuttal — timed (timeout enforced)
     b. Con Agent responds to Pro's argument — timed (timeout enforced)
     c. Judge observes and takes notes (does NOT intervene)
6. After 10 pings:
   a. Judge reviews full debate transcript (JSON)
   b. Judge scores each debater on multiple criteria (see §3.6)
   c. Judge declares winner OR TIE
   d. Full results exported as JSON to results/
```

**Critical rule**: The Father does NOT intervene in the debate. He only listens, takes notes, and delivers the final verdict. Communication is: Sons → Father (one direction).

### 3.4 Blocking & Time Governance

| Parameter | Default | Configurable | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `max_pings` | 10 | Yes | Number of debate pings (rounds) |
| `agent_timeout` | 60s | Yes | Max time per agent turn before process kill |
| `keepalive_interval` | 10s | Yes | Watchdog keep-alive ping interval |
| `max_lines_per_response` | 50 | Yes | Max lines per agent response |
| `max_tokens_per_response` | 1024 | Yes | Max tokens per LLM call |
| `research_timeout` | 120s | Yes | Max time for internet research phase |

- Every agent has a **timeout** — if exceeded, the agent is killed
- **Watchdog** mechanism ensures stuck agents are detected and terminated
- **Keep-alive** pings verify each agent is still responsive
- On timeout/kill: log the event, record a penalty, provide a fallback response

### 3.5 Internet Search & RAG

- **Internet search** is a **primary** requirement — agents must search the web for facts, statistics, expert opinions
- **RAG pipeline** augments search results:
  1. Agent queries search engine (DuckDuckGo — free, no API key needed)
  2. Relevant pages are fetched and chunked
  3. Chunks are embedded and stored in a **local vector store** (session-scoped)
  4. During debate rounds, agents can retrieve relevant chunks from the store
- RAG is **not a replacement for search** — it is an enhancement layer
- The judge also uses search to find **debate expert evaluation criteria**

See also: `docs/PRD_search_engine.md`, `docs/PRD_rag_system.md`

### 3.6 Judge's Evaluation Criteria

The judge evaluates each debater on the following dimensions, each scored 0-100%:

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Argument Strength** | 25% | Logical coherence, evidence quality, persuasiveness |
| **Rebuttal Effectiveness** | 25% | How well the debater addressed and countered the opponent's point |
| **Evidence & Research** | 20% | Use of factual data, statistics, credible sources |
| **Rhetorical Quality** | 15% | Clarity, structure, persuasion technique, rhetorical devices |
| **Compliance** | 15% | Respect, staying on topic, replying to opponent, no contradiction with own stance |

**Penalties** (deducted from final score):
- Disrespectful language: -5% per occurrence
- Ignoring opponent's point: -10% per occurrence
- Contradicting own stance: -15% per occurrence
- Exceeding line limit: -5% per occurrence
- Exceeding time limit (auto-kill): -10% per occurrence

**Ties are valid** — not every debate needs a clear winner. The judge may declare a tie.

See also: `docs/PRD_judge_evaluation.md`

### 3.7 Results & Output

- Full debate transcript saved as **JSON** (`results/<timestamp>_<topic_slug>.json`)
- JSON is the communication protocol between agents (IPC)
- JSON structure:
```json
{
  "topic": "Barcelona vs Real Madrid",
  "pro_agent": "Agent-Pro",
  "con_agent": "Agent-Con",
  "judge": "Agent-Judge",
  "pings": [
    {
      "ping_number": 1,
      "pro_argument": { "text": "...", "lines": 30, "time_seconds": 12.5, "penalties": [] },
      "con_argument": { "text": "...", "lines": 28, "time_seconds": 14.1, "penalties": [] },
      "judge_notes": { "pro": "...", "con": "..." }
    }
  ],

  },
  "winner": "pro",
  "judge_remarks": "..."
}
```

### 3.8 Skills System

- Each agent has a set of **project-local skills** (not global)
- Skills are Python modules stored in `src/debate_simulator/skills/` directory
- Each skill has a **description** that the agent reads to understand when to use it
- Each skill consists of:
  - `skill.md` — description file (what the skill does, when to use it)
  - `skill.py` — implementation file
  - Tools — in Python files, not in `__init__.py` (avoid side-effect imports)
- Skills follow the **Router-Skill pattern**: a router reads all skill descriptions and selects the appropriate one based on the user's message

| Skill | Owner | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `web_search` | All agents | Search the internet for information |
| `rag_retrieve` | All agents | Retrieve relevant context from vector store |
| `rag_store` | All agents | Store fetched content into vector store |
| `fact_check` | Judge | Verify claims made by debaters |
| `stance_check` | Judge | Detect if a debater contradicts their assigned stance |
| `respect_check` | Judge | Detect disrespectful language |
| `rebuttal_check` | Judge | Detect if a debater ignored the opponent's previous point |
| `argument_builder` | Debaters | Construct a structured argument with evidence |
| `rebuttal_builder` | Debaters | Construct a targeted rebuttal to the opponent's point |

### 3.9 Non-Determinism

- The system is designed so that **the same debate can produce different winners** across runs
- This is achieved through:
  - LLM temperature > 0 (default 0.7)
  - Internet search results may vary
  - Order of retrieved RAG chunks may vary
- No seed fixing, no result caching

### 3.10 IPC & Communication

- Agents communicate via **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**
- Communication protocol: **JSON** (JSONL format for streaming)
- Each agent runs as a separate **process**
- IPC mechanisms used: **FIFO (named pipes)**, **Signals**, **Queues**
- Father receives debate data from sons in one direction: Sons → Father

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Logging System (PyPI Package)

- Architecture: **LOG → FIFO → 20 rotating files → 500 lines each**
- Implemented as a **PyPI-style package** within the project
- Configuration in `config/setup.json`:
  - `max_files`: 20
  - `max_lines_per_file`: 500
  - `fifo_path`: configurable
- Implementation:
  1. All agent actions, errors, and system events are logged
  2. Logs are written to a **named pipe (FIFO)** for asynchronous processing
  3. A log consumer writes to **rotating files** (max 20 files, 500 lines each)
  4. When file 20 reaches 500 lines, file 1 is overwritten (circular buffer)
- Log format: `[ISO8601] [LEVEL] [AGENT/COMPONENT] Message`
- Log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`

See also: `docs/PRD_logging_pipeline.md`

### 4.2 SDK-Based Architecture

- The application is built as an **SDK** — single entry point for all logic
- External consumers (CLI, potential GUI, API) interact only through the SDK
- No business logic in the CLI layer
- Architecture layers:
  ```
  External Consumers (CLI / Terminal)
       │
       ▼
  ┌─────────┐
  │   SDK   │  ← Single entry point for ALL logic
  └────┬────┘
       │
       ▼
  ┌─────────────┐
  │  Domain      │  ← Services, models, orchestrators (debate engine, agents)
  │  Services    │
  └────┬────────┘
       │
       ▼
  ┌──────────────┐
  │ Infrastructure│  ← Search, RAG, Logging, LLM client, Gatekeeper
  └──────────────┘
  ```

### 4.3 API Gatekeeper

- **All** external API calls (LLM, search) go through a centralized **API Gatekeeper**
- Features:
  - **Rate limiting** per minute/hour (configurable in `config/rate_limits.json`)
  - **Request queueing** — FIFO queue when rate limit reached
  - **Retry logic** — exponential backoff on transient failures
  - **Logging** — every API call is logged
  - **No hardcoded credentials** — all secrets from `.env`

See also: `docs/PRD_api_gatekeeper.md`

### 4.4 Terminal-Only Interface

- Primary interface: **terminal / CLI** via `rich` library
- The SDK is the primary interface — terminal is a consumer of the SDK
- Optional GUI for visualization (not required, but allowed)
- Must run in **environments with minimal Python packages installed**

### 4.5 Configuration

- **No hardcoded constants** — all parameters from config files or `.env`
- `.env.example` submitted (no real keys) — professor adds API key
- Config structure:
  - `config/setup.json` — main application config (versioned)
  - `config/rate_limits.json` — API rate limits (versioned)
  - `.env` — secrets (git-ignored)
- Constants stored in `src/debate_simulator/shared/constants.py` (immutable)
- Enum types for fixed-value parameters

### 4.6 Process Management

- Each agent runs in its own **subprocess** (multiprocessing)
- **Timeout** on every agent — if exceeded, process is killed
- **Watchdog** mechanism with keep-alive pings to detect stuck agents
- On kill: log the event, record a penalty, use a fallback response

See also: `docs/PRD_process_management.md`

### 4.7 Error Handling & Graceful Degradation

- Every error is logged (see §4.1)
- Graceful degradation: if search fails, agents proceed with their own knowledge
- If RAG fails, agents proceed without retrieval augmentation
- If an agent crashes, the debate continues with the remaining agent receiving a default penalty
- Edge cases tested: empty input, null responses, concurrent failures

### 4.8 Code Quality Standards

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Max file length** | 150 lines per file |
| **Linter** | Ruff — 0 errors (`ruff check`) |
| **Code comments** | "Why" not "what" — explain decisions, not obvious code |
| **Docstrings** | All functions, classes, methods must have docstrings |
| **Type hints** | All public functions must have type annotations |
| **DRY** | Don't Repeat Yourself — extract shared logic |
| **Single Responsibility** | Each function/class has one clear purpose |
| **No hardcoded constants** | All from config files or `.env` |

### 4.9 Testing Standards (TDD)

| Standard | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Methodology** | TDD — RED → GREEN → REFACTOR for every feature |
| **Coverage** | Minimum **85%** (statement, branch, path coverage) |
| **Test structure** | Mirror `src/` structure in `tests/` |
| **Test naming** | One assertion per test function |
| **Fixtures** | Shared fixtures in `conftest.py` |
| **Mocking** | Mock all external services (API, search, DB) |
| **Automated** | Tests run on every commit (CI/CD ready) |
| **Edge cases** | Tested — boundary conditions, empty inputs, failures |
| **Graceful degradation** | Tested — simulate failures, verify fallback behavior |

### 4.10 Version Management

- Version starts at **1.00** across all versioned files:
  - `src/debate_simulator/shared/version.py`
  - `config/setup.json` (`"version"` field)
  - `config/rate_limits.json` (`"rate_limits.version"` field)

### 4.11 Prompt Engineering Log

- Every prompt used in the system must be documented with:
  - **Purpose** — what the prompt achieves
  - **Context** — when and why it was designed this way
  - **Iterations** — what was changed and why (based on results)
  - **Performance** — qualitative assessment of prompt effectiveness

### 4.12 Cost & Token Tracking

- Track API token usage per model (input tokens, output tokens, total cost)
- Track per agent (Judge, Pro, Con)
- Summary table in results and README

- **Python only** — no other languages
- **Must run on professor's machine** — installable via `uv sync`
- **No external paid services** beyond the LLM API (professor's key)
- **No hardcoded constants** — all from config or `.env`
- **Max 150 lines per file** — split into modules/mixins/classes/functions/constants
- **Ruff linter must pass with 0 errors**
- **Test coverage must be >= 85%**
- **Version starts at 1.00**
